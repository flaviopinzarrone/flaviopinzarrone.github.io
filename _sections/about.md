Iâ€™m an AI Research Engineer with a particular interest in autonomous robotic systems, and the application of AI to onboard perception, control and state estimation solutions.
Currently I support the TII Racing drone racing team, with which I competed in the 2025 A2RL Drone Race, achieving the second place in the AI Grand Challenge and the first place in the AI Multi-Drone Challenge
